In this exercise, we have prepared six different and fully automated
clusterings of 100 images from the COP21 conference, collected as part of the
*PolarVis* project. The goal is for you to explore the different solutions,
critically evaluate their quality and discuss the potential usefullness of
these methods for discovery and measurement in the social sciences, as well as
how we can establish criteria and best practices for validation.

**Questions**

1. Given the knowledge you have about the data, what are your expectations about:

    1. The number of clusters (categories) that you expect to find?
    2. The size of the clusters? Are they all of the same size? Do they follow some distribution?
    3. The content of the clusters, i.e. what kind of images do you expect to find in each cluster?

2. Out of the six clusterings, select the one that you as a group think is
	``best'' and for the selected clustering answer the following
	questions:
    1. Why did you select this particular clustering?
    2. How did you use the different validation strategies to make your selection? Was it helpful?
    3. Try to interpret each cluster from the selected clustering and provide a label for each cluster.
	  What concepts do they operationalize? Are they scientifically relevant?

3. Cluster quality can be improved by brining the researcher back into the
	loop and providing feedback to the clustering algorithms in the form of
	constraints. This nudges the algorithm to consider *your*
	objective function, prior knowledge and domain expertise. 
    1. For the selected clustering, what would you change? Please answer in terms of 1. the number of clusters
	  and 2. must-link and cannot-link constraints between images (i.e.
	  image a and b must be in the same cluster, or image a and b cannot be
	  in the same cluster).
    2. In general, what kind of constraints would you like to be able to
	    provide to the clustering algorithm?
